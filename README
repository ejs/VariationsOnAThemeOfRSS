Gven a small list of valid RSS feeds in a text file called feeds.lst write a simple Python script to fetch each feed and print the title and date of each of the feeds' entries to the console.

Multiple HTTP requests should be made in parallel but should be limited (to some arbitrarily low number for the purpose of this exercise, e.g. 3-5 concurrent requests) to avoid consuming the computer's resources.

Use any form of concurrency (multi-process, multi-thread, cooperative threads, event-driven, etc) and can make use of available packages such as feedparser, http://pypi.python.org/pypi/FeedParser, to help.

If a feed cannot be downloaded it can simply be ignored, as long as the failure does not cause the whole script to die.
